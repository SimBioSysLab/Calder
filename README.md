# SimEngine
SimEngine is an open-source similarity measurement and feature selection repository in Python. It is build upon several standard math libraries(e.g. math, Numpy) and machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, Scipy).
SimEngine could be used to determine the similarity between proxy and parent applications. It also includes algorithms to facilitate feature selection, as minimizing the number of features is very important to reduce the data collected and thus lower the number of application runs.
With the help of the quantitative similarity measurement we have developed in SimEngine, users are guided to choose proper proxy applications for particular uses. Besides quantifying fidelity of proxy applications, similarity measurement approaches in SimEngine can also be applied to various HPC problems, such as compiler optimization, code refactoring, and application input sensitivity.
